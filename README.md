#Out of the Ruby Tar Pit

![](http://i.imgur.com/wF8vC6a.gif)

This is a dubiously architected, debatably insane implementation of the example "functional relational programming" system in [Out of the Tar Pit (Mosley and Marks, 2006)](http://shaffner.us/cs/papers/tarpit.pdf).

Run the example with `ruby example/example.rb`.

[AcceptedOffer](example/derived-relations/accepted-offer.rb) and [PropertyInfo](example/derived-relations/property-info.rb) are interesting examples.

I wasn't on drugs when I wrote this. I probably should have been.

Cool PR? Totally different implementation? A weird fork that bears no resemblance to whatever monster I've created? I want to see it.
