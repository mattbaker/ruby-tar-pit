#Out of the Ruby Tar Pit

This is an experimental implementation of the example "functional relational programming" system in [Out of the Tar Pit (Mosley and Marks, 2006)](http://shaffner.us/cs/papers/tarpit.pdf).

Run example with `ruby example/example.rb`.

[AcceptedOffer](example/derived-relations/accepted-offer.rb) and [PropertyInfo](example/derived-relations/property-info.rb) are interesting examples.


##Warning
Experimental work in progress, there are dragons in here.
