#Out of the Ruby tar pit

This is an experimental implementation of the example "functional relational programming" system in [Out of the tarpit, Mosley and Marks](http://shaffner.us/cs/papers/tarpit.pdf).

[PropertyInfo](./property-info.rb) is currently the most complicated example.

Work in progress, there are dragons in here.
